# The Digital Twin for an Organisation

This repository contains code for generating configuration objects to create digital twins via a component structure. 
It includes a core ComponentSDK and specialized structures for PipelineSDK, MicroserviceSDK, and ThirdPartySDK, which 
can be utilized as helper SDKs for developers.

## ComponentSDK

The ComponentSDK serves as the foundational building block for defining and validating components within the digital 
twin framework. It includes abstract classes for metadata contracts, implementation, and infrastructure, along with 
validation against JSON schemas. This validation process ensures that the metadata, implementation, and infrastructure 
of a component adhere to the specified schema, providing robust error handling and consistency across components.

### Featured Classes:

- **MetaDataContract**: Defines the contract for metadata, including ports, data contracts, and other attributes.
- **Implementation**: Contains the logic specific to the implementation of a component.
- **Infrastructure**: Describes the infrastructure requirements and configurations for a component.

## PipelineSDK

The PipelineSDK extends the ComponentSDK to model data pipelines, providing specific classes and methods for:

- **ETL Configuration**: Define ETL processes using a fluent API.
- **Resource Allocation**: Specify CPU, RAM, and other resource requirements.
- **Job Scheduling**: Schedule jobs for batch or streaming execution.

## MicroserviceSDK

The MicroserviceSDK, an extension of the ComponentSDK, allows for the definition and configuration of microservices, 
including:

- **Endpoint Configuration**: Define HTTP methods, paths, and parameters.
- **Request/Response Contracts**: Specify contracts for each endpoint.
- **Deployment Configuration**: Define settings such as scaling, replicas, and environment variables.

## ThirdPartySDK

The ThirdPartySDK extends the ComponentSDK to model third-party components, offering classes and methods for:

- **API Integration**: Define authentication, endpoints, and request/response formats.
- **Library Configuration**: Specify dependencies and configurations.
- **External Services**: Configure connections to databases, message brokers, and cloud providers.

## Getting Started

Refer to the individual SDK documentation and example code for detailed instructions on defining and configuring
components, pipelines, microservices, and third-party integrations.
